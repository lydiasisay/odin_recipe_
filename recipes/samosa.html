    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A samosa is a popular savory pastry originating from South Asia, known for its crispy, golden-brown exterior and delicious filling. Typically shaped like a triangle, it is made from thin layers of dough that are folded around a mixture of spiced potatoes, peas, and sometimes meat, then deep-fried until perfectly crunchy. The filling is often seasoned with a blend of aromatic spices, such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala, giving the samosa its signature flavor. Served hot, samosas are frequently accompanied by tangy chutneys or yogurt for dipping, making them a favorite snack or appetizer at gatherings and street food stalls. Their delightful crunch and savory taste have earned them a special place in the hearts of food lovers around the world.
