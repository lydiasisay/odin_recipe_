    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hamburger is a classic American dish that typically consists of a juicy ground beef patty, grilled to perfection and placed between two soft, round buns. It's often topped with a variety of condiments and garnishes, such as crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, tangy pickles, and melting cheese, adding layers of flavor and texture. The combination of savory beef and fresh toppings creates a satisfying meal that can be customized to suit individual tastes, whether you prefer it spicy with jalape√±os, sweet with barbecue sauce, or classic with ketchup and mustard. Enjoyed at backyard barbecues, fast-food joints, or gourmet restaurants, the hamburger is a beloved comfort food that brings people together.</p>
